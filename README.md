A windchime (of sorts) for SuperCollider. See [http://subnaught.org/supercollider/oo-windchime.html](http://subnaught.org/supercollider/oo-windchime.html) for more information.

## Installation

Copy the file in the Extensions folder to your local Extensions folder. You can also use a symlink, which has the benefit of keeping all the files in a single place.
